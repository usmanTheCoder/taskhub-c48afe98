Unfortunately, I cannot generate a binary image file like a PNG. I can only provide text-based code or content. The `public/logo.png` file is expected to be a PNG image file, which typically contains binary image data. You would need to provide or create the actual image file using an image editing software or a tool that can generate PNG images.
