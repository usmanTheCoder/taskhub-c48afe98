π§ββοΈ This is a binary font file. I cannot generate or modify binary font files directly. However, I can provide you with instructions on how to include and use this font file in your project.

To include the Inter Bold font in your project, you'll need to download the Inter Bold font file (inter-bold.ttf) from a trusted source, such as the official Google Fonts repository (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter).

After downloading the font file, place it in the `public/fonts/` directory of your project. Then, you can import and use this font in your CSS or Tailwind CSS configuration.

For example, in your `tailwind.config.js` file, you can add the following configuration to include the Inter Bold font:

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        inter: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
        'inter-bold': ['Inter-Bold', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Now, you can use the `inter-bold` font family in your Tailwind CSS utilities or CSS files:

```html
<p class="font-inter-bold">This text will use the Inter Bold font</p>
```

```css
.custom-class {
  font-family: 'Inter-Bold', sans-serif;
}
```

Make sure to adjust the font file paths and font family names according to your project structure and requirements.
